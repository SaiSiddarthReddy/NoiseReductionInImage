# Image-Noise-Reduction-with-Autoencoders
In real world we may not always get clean images they may be noisy.In this project I used mnist dataset added some noise to the images used autoencoder to reduce noise in the images and predict the output of the noisy images with high accuracy.

You can simply pull the repo and run the notebook to see how it works.
